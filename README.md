# House-Stumble

This is a project that started as a simple game engine, and still acts somewhat as an engine, but adapted into just a game. HouseStumble.ifd is the game file, which the engine parses. The .ifd file type format was provided by the instructor of the course in which this project was assigned, but the final .ifd was adapted to be parsed by the engine and changed slightly to fit the needs of the game.
